# Backtesting Basic Trading Strategies
In the world of trading, there are some basic strategies that are often considered too simplistic and are not recommended due to their widespread popularity. If these strategies were consistently profitable, they would be widely adopted, which would diminish their effectiveness. In this project, we aim to backtest different trading strategies over varying periods of 10, 15, and 20 years. To assess their performance, we will analyze the outcomes for the ten companies with the largest market capitalization during each selected timeframe. For now, I´ve only finished one strategy, but I will work on multiple ones in the future. Any ideas about other strategies I should work on is appreciated

## Strategy 1: Trading Based on Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The first strategy we explore revolves around the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator. This approach is straightforward: when the stock price is above the SMA, we will execute a buy order, and when it falls below the SMA, we will execute a sell order. To test the effectiveness of this strategy, we will consider different SMA timeframes, namely 10, 50, and 200 days.


## Getting Started
